Second :  Configure the privoxy to use socks5 as http

sudo nano /etc/privoxy/config 

Then press CTRL+W and search  listen-address  clear # behind it and write it like this yourip:8118

After that go to the end of the file and write this 

forward-socks5t / 127.0.0.1:9050     

Notic : about the the 9050   if you forwareded your port to the other port number you must set that

Example i set tor port as i said i portforward.txt to 8585 i must change 9050 to 8585
