First : install privoxy

sudo apt install privoxy

Second :  Configure the privoxy to use socks5 as http

sudo nano /etc/privoxy/config 

Then press CTRL+W and search  listen-address  clear # behind it and write it like this 

192.168.110.251(YOUR_IP):8118

After that go to the end of the file and write this 

forward-socks5t / 127.0.0.1:9050 .    

Notic : about the the 9050   if you forwareded your port to the other port number you must set that

Example i set tor port as i said i port-forward.txt to 8585 i must change 9050 to 8585

Third (End part) :  you sholud save your changes with press CRTL+X and press Y and then press ENTER in the end you have to run this command 

sudo service privoxy restart

Now have fun  you can set your ip to your browser with this port 8118  and you must set it as HTTP    

example :

HTTP 192.168.110.251 8118

Enjoy :)
